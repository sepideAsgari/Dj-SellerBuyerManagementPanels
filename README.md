## SellerBuyerManagementPanels
This project is an e-commerce website that includes panels for both sellers and buyers.
Sellers can add their products to the site, and after the site admin approves them,
the products are made available for sale on the website.


## Product Sales Website

This is a product sales website . It manages and sells products for the business owner as well as other sellers.
One of its features is that the site owner can also sell products as a vendor.


## Other features include:
- User login and registration
- Vendor login and registration
- Checking the status of purchased goods
- Popular products
- And more...

Regarding the libraries used in Django:
No unique libraries were used. For the UI, Bulma and Babel were used.

The database used is PostgreSQL. Similarly, standard Django libraries were utilized, which I will send as an attachment.

For the server-side, Nginx, Gunicorn, and Supervisor were used to ensure the project can be expanded in the future and handle an increased number of users and request processing.

The project will be deployed on the host soon.
